        <p><strong>Controller:</strong> UAB Taratorkin Official and its affiliates (“Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy describes what personal and non-personal information we collect in connection with the mobile applications, games and digital services we provide (the “Apps” or “Services”), why we collect it, how we use and share it, how long we retain it, and how to contact us.</p>

        <p><strong>Public policy URL:</strong> <a href="https://taratorkinofficial.wordpress.com/policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://taratorkinofficial.wordpress.com/policy</a><br/>

        <p><em>Important — Audience, structure and how to read this policy:</em> We publish Apps for different audiences. Some Apps are intended for general audiences (adults/teens), and some App versions or sections may be directed to or accessible by children. This Policy is structured in three parts:</p>
        <ul class="policy-list">
          <li><strong>Chapter A — Children:</strong> apps or sections intended for children (stricter rules apply).</li>
          <li><strong>Chapter B — General Apps:</strong> apps for general audiences (standard rules).</li>
          <li><strong>Chapter C — Common terms:</strong> applies to both A and B (cookies, third parties, rights, retention, transfers, security, contact).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If an App includes an age-gate, your selection determines whether Chapter A or Chapter B applies to you.</p>
      </section>

      <hr class="policy-sep">

      <!-- Chapter A -->
      <section id="children">
        <h2>Chapter A — Children Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>A.1 Overview and core rule</h3>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information that directly identifies a child (such as name, email, phone, or home address) from children under the applicable minimum age except as permitted by law and platform rules. For children we limit collection to a minimal set of data necessary for app functionality and safety.</p>

        <h3>A.2 Age-gate and designation</h3>
        <p>Some Apps include an age-gate. If a User selects an age below the configured threshold (e.g., under 16), the App's children rules will apply to that session or section.</p>

        <h3>A.3 Data types we may collect from children (limited)</h3>
        <ul class="policy-list">
          <li>Non-identifying device & usage data: device model, OS version, app version, session timestamps, levels reached, aggregated gameplay metrics, crash logs and diagnostics.</li>
          <li>Persistent device identifiers (limited): advertising identifier (GAID/IDFA) or randomly generated user ID used only for internal operations — not linked to identifying info for children.</li>
          <li>Generalized location: country or city level derived from IP (no precise GPS for children unless lawful and parental consent obtained).</li>
          <li>Local storage data required for offline functionality or to preserve game state.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A.4 Prohibited children data</h3>
        <p>We do not collect or permit third parties to collect children's direct identifiers (name, email, home address, phone), financial data, contact lists, or sensitive categories (race, health, religion) — except upon verifiable parental consent where legally permitted.</p>

        <h3>A.5 Support requests by children</h3>
        <p>If a child provides contact info when contacting support, we use it only to respond and then promptly delete it unless retention is authorized by a parent/guardian or required by law.</p>

        <h3>A.6 Advertising and third-party partners for children</h3>
        <p>We do not permit behavioral interest-based advertising to children. Ads shown (if any) are contextual and served only via third parties who comply with applicable children’s privacy laws and platform rules.</p>

        <h3>A.7 Sharing children’s data</h3>
        <p>Children's persistent device identifiers may be shared only in very limited cases (e.g., law enforcement, fraud prevention, or with parental consent). We do not share identifying children’s personal data with advertisers or analytics providers.</p>

        <h3>A.8 Parental rights</h3>
        <p>Parents/legal guardians may contact us at <a href="mailto:taratorkin.official@gmail.com">taratorkin.official@gmail.com</a> to request access, correction or deletion of their child’s data. We will verify identity where required by law and comply with valid requests promptly.</p>

      <!-- Chapter B -->
      <section id="general">
        <h2>Chapter B — General Apps Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>B.1 Overview</h3>
        <p>This chapter applies to Users of apps not designated as children-targeted and to Users who indicate they are above the age gate. We may collect broader categories of data here, but with reasonable limits and lawful bases.</p>

        <h3>B.2 Categories of information we collect</h3>
        <ul class="policy-list">
          <li><strong>Information you provide:</strong> contact/support info (email, nickname), content you create or upload, transaction identifiers (order ID, receipt).</li>
          <li><strong>Device & technical information:</strong> device model, OS version, language, screen size, advertising identifiers (GAID/IDFA), Android ID, app-specific user IDs, app version, SDKs, crash logs, IP address.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage & analytics:</strong> gameplay data (levels reached, session durations, in-app events), performance diagnostics.</li>
          <li><strong>Location:</strong> general location derived from IP; precise GPS only with explicit permission and purpose.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookies & local storage:</strong> data used to maintain preferences and session state on the device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B.3 How we use the information (purposes & legal bases)</h3>
        <p>We process data to: provide and operate the App; improve and develop the App; ensure security and fraud prevention; process payments; serve ads and measure their performance (consent where required); provide customer support; and comply with legal obligations.</p>

        <h3>B.4 Advertising & ad identifiers</h3>
        <p>We and our ad partners may use Advertising IDs (GAID/IDFA) to deliver, measure and improve ad experiences. You can reset or limit ad personalization via device settings (Android: Ads settings; iOS: Limit Ad Tracking / tracking settings).</p>

        <h3>B.5 Sharing — who we share with and why</h3>
        <p>We may share data with service providers (analytics, hosting, payments, support platforms), advertising partners (for ad serving and measurement), affiliates and partners (business transfers), and law enforcement when required. Third parties must process data per our instructions and maintain safeguards.</p>

        <h3>B.6 User-generated content</h3>
        <p>Content you publish via the App may be visible to others per your sharing settings. You are responsible for what you choose to publish.</p>

      <!-- Chapter C -->
      <section id="common">
        <h2>Chapter C — Common terms</h2>

        <h3>C.1 Third-party list and SDKs</h3>
        <p>We use third-party SDKs and vendors — ad networks, analytics providers, crash reporters, and payment providers. We maintain a representative list of major third parties at: <a href="https://taratorkinofficial.wordpress.com/policy#third-parties" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy#third-parties</a>.</p>

        <h3>C.2 Cookies, local storage & offline data</h3>
        <p>Our Apps and third-party SDKs may use local storage to keep preferences, cap ad frequency, and for analytics. Offline features may operate without Internet; until connectivity is restored no data is transmitted.</p>

        <h3>C.3 Retention periods (typical)</h3>
        <ul class="policy-list">
          <li>Crash logs & short-term diagnostics: up to 14 days;</li>
          <li>Usage analytics (aggregated/anonymized): up to 24 months;</li>
          <li>Transaction records (receipts): up to 7 years for tax/compliance;</li>
          <li>Account data: while account is active; after deletion we remove or anonymize data within ~30–90 days unless legal obligations require longer retention.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C.4 International transfers</h3>
        <p>Data may be processed or stored in countries outside your residence. We use appropriate safeguards (standard contractual clauses or adequacy mechanisms) to protect transfers.</p>

        <h3>C.5 Security</h3>
        <p>We use industry-standard measures (encryption in transit, access controls, secure hosting). No system is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h3>C.6 Your rights</h3>
        <p>To the extent applicable, you have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict processing, portability, object to processing, and withdraw consent. To exercise rights contact <a href="mailto:taratorkin.official@gmail.com">taratorkin.official@gmail.com</a>. We may ask for identity verification as required.</p>

        <h3>C.7 California Privacy (CCPA / CPRA)</h3>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you may have rights to request categories of data collected, purposes, categories of third parties, deletion, and opt out of sale. To exercise these rights email <a href="mailto:taratorkin.official@gmail.com">taratorkin.official@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h3>C.8 Law enforcement & legal requests</h3>
        <p>We will disclose personal data in response to valid legal process or to protect rights, property, or safety.</p>

        <h3>C.9 Deletion & portability</h3>
        <p>To request deletion, export, or correction of data send an email to <a href="mailto:taratorkin.official@gmail.com">taratorkin.official@gmail.com</a>. Include app package name and device identifiers if available. We may require verification.</p>

        <h3>C.10 Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Policy. Material changes will be posted at the policy URL with an updated “Last revised” date and, where required, notified in the App or via the store listing.</p>
